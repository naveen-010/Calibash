# CLI Calendar Project

Welcome to my CLI-based calendar project! This Python program allows users to navigate dates, manage events with ease using natural language, and import/export event data through CSV filesâ€”all from the command line.

## Features

- **Navigate Between Dates**: Effortlessly move between months and years, or jump to specific dates.
- **Switch Views**: Toggle between month and year views for different calendar perspectives.
- **Smart Event Management**: Add, remove, edit, and view events using plain language. No strict syntax required!
- **CSV Import/Export**: 
  - Export: The program creates an `events.csv` file in the current working directory if one doesn't already exist.
  - Import: Reads a provided `events.csv` file specified through CLI arguments, ensuring seamless data flow.
- **First-Time Setup**: Automatically creates `events.csv` on first run if not present, ensuring a smooth start.
